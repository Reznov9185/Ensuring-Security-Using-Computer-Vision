Ensuring Security with Computer Vision

In our implementation, we have used devices and computers which are general in terms
of computation, performance and efficiency. The results would be more satisfactory if
devices and computers with higher computational ability could be used. In the next
iteration, such devices can be used. Considering computation for better computational
time and efficiency, we could reduce the number of recognition performed on the same
person while they are in our observation window. We can achieve this by tracking a
recognized person while they are in our observation window.
We have proposed and implemented a security system considering the scenario of an
organizational security. Our aim was to derive data in real time so that extracted data
can be helpful as a tool to ensure and enhance security. Systems with surveillance

monitoring ability are existent and already in use at various sectors to ensure security.
We tried to emphasize more on the data extraction part compared to data analysis section
and completed the first phase of our research. We don’t have conclusive improvement
over the existing systems but it creates a new horizon to look at the surveillance systems
with computer vision. This thesis can prove to be helpful for anyone who wants to
enhance security using computer vision and proper data analysis for efficient data
extraction.
To recognize all faces in a crowded place, we have to ensure that our observation area
is covered from all possible angles with multiple cameras. We can observe the result
produces from such scenario in next iterations to come.
We only covered certain cases for testing and calculating data. More test cases with
efficient parameters can be tested in our next iterations for more accurate conclusion.
We can pinpoint a person's location in three dimension by calculating the intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters of cameras. Stereo Vision in this scenario can help us pinpoint a
person's accurate location which can have various applications.
By moving our data storage from RDBMS to NoSQL, big data analysis can be
performed for important data extraction. Such data can help us predict possible future
scenarios and take proper precautions.
Our systems can be improved much further by using advanced machine learning
techniques. Open sourced machine learning API’s are available. Google’s Tensor flow
[41] is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow
graphs. Even though the purposes of TensorFlow is conducting machine learning and
deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a
wide variety of other domains as well. IBM Watson [42] provide cognitive computing
systems which understand natural language and are not programmed, they learn. It can
perform reasoning and provide reasonable conclusion on various topics. Integration of
these machine learning algorithms can be performed in next iterations.
